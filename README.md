## howhow-fastfetch-config

This is a simple detailed fastfetch config.jsonc template, if you want to simply install my presets then feel free to run install.sh
```sh
curl https://github.com/howhow2315/fastfetch-config/blob/main/install.sh | sh
```
```sh
curl https://github.com/howhow2315/fastfetch-config/blob/main/uninstall.sh | sh
```

If you want to replace the ascii, replace `ascii/ascii.txt` with whatever youd like

If you want to modify anything and need information, I (heartbreakingly) recommend looking at the provided Json-Schema.
```sh
git clone https:⁄⁄github.com⁄fastfetch-cli⁄fastfetch.wiki.git
```

I left as much information as I could regarding possible configuration, however as its straight forward and purely information driven its partially up to you to fill in the gaps
If you want to check a modules modern json formatting then you can run `fastfetch -h ${module}-format`
